## Debug Mode

GDBLE provides optional debug mode to help troubleshoot issues.

### Enable Debug Mode

```gdscript
# Enable debug mode - show detailed logs
bluetooth_manager.set_debug_mode(true)
```


### Debug Output Example

When debug mode is enabled, you'll see detailed internal logs:

```
[BLE Info] Starting Bluetooth adapter initialization
[BLE Debug] Checking initialization state
[BLE Debug] Creating Tokio runtime manager
[BLE Debug] Acquiring Bluetooth adapter
[BLE Info] Bluetooth adapter acquired successfully
[BLE Info] Starting BLE device scan for 10 seconds
[BLE Debug] Spawning scan task asynchronously
[BLE Info] Discovered device: MyDevice (XX:XX:XX:XX:XX:XX), RSSI: -45
```

### Disable Debug Mode

```gdscript
# Disable debug mode (default) - keep output clean
bluetooth_manager.set_debug_mode(false)
```

### Conditional Debugging

```gdscript
# Enable only in debug builds
bluetooth_manager.set_debug_mode(OS.is_debug_build())
```

---

## FAQ

### Q: Why can't I find any devices?

**A:** Please check:
1. Ensure Bluetooth adapter is enabled
2. Ensure target device is in advertising state
3. Check if device is within range (usually within 10 meters)
4. Enable debug mode to view detailed logs

### Q: What if device connection fails?

**A:** Possible reasons:
1. Device is already connected by another application
2. Device is out of range
3. Device battery is low
4. Pairing required but not paired

### Q: How to handle device disconnection?

**A:** Listen to the `disconnected` signal:

```gdscript
device.disconnected.connect(_on_device_disconnected)

func _on_device_disconnected():
    print("Device disconnected, attempting reconnection...")
    # Implement reconnection logic
```

### Q: Write operation has no response?

**A:** Check:
1. Does characteristic support write (check `properties.write`)
2. Is data format correct
3. Do you need to use `with_response` parameter
4. Enable debug mode to view error messages

### Q: How to find correct service and characteristic UUIDs?

**A:** 
1. Check device documentation or specifications
2. Use debug mode to view all services
3. Use standard BLE services (e.g., heart rate, battery)
4. Use third-party BLE scanning tools (e.g., nRF Connect)

### Q: Does it support connecting to multiple devices simultaneously?

**A:** Yes, GDBLE supports managing multiple device connections:

```gdscript
var device1 = bluetooth_manager.connect_device(address1)
var device2 = bluetooth_manager.connect_device(address2)
```


### Q: How's the performance? Will it affect game frame rate?

**A:** GDBLE uses async architecture, all Bluetooth operations execute in background threads, won't block main thread or affect game frame rate.

## Data Format Description

### DeviceInfo Dictionary

Device information dictionary contains the following fields:

```gdscript
{
    "name": String,      # Device name (may be empty)
    "address": String,   # Device address (UUID or MAC)
    "rssi": int         # Signal strength (dBm)
}
```

### Service Dictionary

Service dictionary contains the following fields:

```gdscript
{
    "uuid": String,                    # Service UUID
    "characteristics": Array[Dictionary]  # Characteristics list
}
```

### Characteristic Dictionary

Characteristic dictionary contains the following fields:

```gdscript
{
    "uuid": String,        # Characteristic UUID
    "properties": {        # Characteristic properties
        "read": bool,                    # Can read
        "write": bool,                   # Can write (with response)
        "write_without_response": bool,  # Can write (without response)
        "notify": bool,                  # Supports notifications
        "indicate": bool                 # Supports indications
    }
}
```

---

## Best Practices

### 1. Error Handling

Always handle error cases:

```gdscript
bluetooth_manager.adapter_initialized.connect(func(success, error):
    if not success:
        push_error("Bluetooth initialization failed: " + error)
        # Show error message to user
)

device.connection_failed.connect(func(error):
    push_error("Connection failed: " + error)
    # Retry or notify user
)
```

### 2. Resource Cleanup

Clean up resources when node is destroyed:

```gdscript
func _exit_tree():
    if device and device.is_connected():
        device.disconnect()
    if bluetooth_manager:
        bluetooth_manager.stop_scan()
```

### 3. Timeout Handling

Set timeout for long-running operations:

```gdscript
var connection_timeout = 10.0
var timeout_timer: Timer

func connect_with_timeout(address: String):
    timeout_timer = Timer.new()
    add_child(timeout_timer)
    timeout_timer.timeout.connect(_on_connection_timeout)
    timeout_timer.start(connection_timeout)
    
    device = bluetooth_manager.connect_device(address)
    device.connected.connect(_on_connected)
    device.connect_async()

func _on_connected():
    timeout_timer.stop()
    print("Connection successful")

func _on_connection_timeout():
    print("Connection timeout")
    if device:
        device.disconnect()
```


### 4. State Management

Maintain clear connection state:

```gdscript
enum DeviceState {
    DISCONNECTED,
    CONNECTING,
    CONNECTED,
    DISCOVERING_SERVICES,
    READY
}

var device_state = DeviceState.DISCONNECTED

func connect_device(address: String):
    device_state = DeviceState.CONNECTING
    device = bluetooth_manager.connect_device(address)
    # ...

func _on_connected():
    device_state = DeviceState.CONNECTED
    device.discover_services()
    device_state = DeviceState.DISCOVERING_SERVICES

func _on_services_discovered(services: Array):
    device_state = DeviceState.READY
    # Now ready for read/write operations
```

### 5. Data Validation

Validate received data:

```gdscript
func _on_characteristic_read(char_uuid: String, data: PackedByteArray):
    if data.size() == 0:
        push_warning("Received empty data")
        return
    
    if data.size() < expected_size:
        push_warning("Data length insufficient")
        return
    
    # Process data
    process_data(data)
```

## Performance Optimization Tips

### 1. Scan Optimization

```gdscript
# Use appropriate scan time
bluetooth_manager.start_scan(5.0)  # 5 seconds is usually enough

# Stop scanning immediately after finding target device
func _on_device_discovered(info: Dictionary):
    if info.get("name") == target_name:
        bluetooth_manager.stop_scan()
```

### 2. Write Optimization

```gdscript
# For data that doesn't need confirmation, use write without response
device.write_characteristic(service, char, data, false)  # Faster

# For important data, use write with response
device.write_characteristic(service, char, data, true)   # More reliable
```

### 3. Notification Optimization

```gdscript
# Only subscribe to needed characteristics
device.subscribe_characteristic(service, char)

# Unsubscribe when no longer needed
device.unsubscribe_characteristic(service, char)
```

## Troubleshooting

### Enable Detailed Logging

```gdscript
bluetooth_manager.set_debug_mode(true)
```

### Check Adapter Status

```gdscript
if not bluetooth_manager.is_initialized():
    print("Adapter not initialized")
```

### Verify Device Connection

```gdscript
if device and device.is_connected():
    print("Device connected")
else:
    print("Device not connected")
```

### View Discovered Services

```gdscript
func _on_services_discovered(services: Array):
    print("Discovered services:")
    for service in services:
        print("  Service: ", service.get("uuid"))
        for char in service.get("characteristics", []):
            print("    Characteristic: ", char.get("uuid"))
            print("    Properties: ", char.get("properties"))
```
